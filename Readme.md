## Setup Instructions â€“ Local environment  

#### 1. Setup and host your Azure DevTunnel
[Azure DevTunnels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview) is an Azure service that enables you to share local web services hosted on the internet. Use the commands below to connect your local development environment to the public internet. This creates a tunnel with a persistent endpoint URL and which allows anonymous access. We will then use this endpoint to notify your application of chat and job router events from the Azure Communication Service.
```bash
devtunnel host -p 8000 -allow-anonymous
```
Make a note of the devtunnel URI. You will need it at later steps.
